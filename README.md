# Algorithms and Data Structures
Here I'm learning algorithms and data structures using Node.js

- Getting started
  - download node.js onto your local machine
  - download this repository
  - In your terminal/command line, nagivigate from your root directory to the directory you're trying out
  - Type `node [file name] [numbers separated by spaces]` (Do not include brackets)
