# Algorithms and Data Structures
Here I'm learning algorithms and data structures using Node.js

- Getting started
  - download node.js onto your local machine
  - download this repository
  - In your terminal/command line, nagivigate from your root directory to the downloaded repository
  - Type `node [file name]` (Do not include brackets)
  - (Optional) upload repository to your prefered IDE, aka text editor
    - Add, remove, or mix up values within the data structure (don't forget to save)
